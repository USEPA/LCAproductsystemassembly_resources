The process is an agglomeration of data from a nationwide survey of CDD MRFs conducted by the Construction and Demolition Recycling Association (CDRA) and includes detailed infrastructure and equipment inventories from an in-depth study of 2 large-scale mixed CDD MRFs located in the southeastern US. Sixteen respondents to the CDRA (2015) provided information on mixed CDD MRF throughput, diversion rates, facility size (i.e., acreage), electricity consumption, and fuel consumption.","version":"00.00.007","lastChange":"2019-08-26T14:48:57.118-04:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"8fe94e58-e9a1-3e98-8175-26f3701e5f7f","name":"5621: Waste Collection","categoryPath":["56: Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"US"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"The start and end dates represent the bounds of the time period for which this dataset is intended to be representative.","technologyDescription":"Mixed CDD MRFs typically utilize automated and manual processes to separate a mixed incoming CDD stream into individual material categories and then market the segregated materials to different end users. Some CDD MRFs include additional processing steps (e.g., concrete crushing, woody debris grinding). This dataset is intended to represent the average nationwide CDD MRF employing the average recovery technologies.","dataCollectionDescription":"Data taken from CDRA (2015) represents a 2014 nationwide survey of construction and demolition debris recycling (i.e., processing) facilities. Detailed equipment inventories, construction material inventory, and water consumption estimates were compiled from site visits to confidential, operating mixed CDD MRFs in the southeastern US. Additional publication dates for the sources used in the development of this dataset range from 1985 to 2016. Specific data collection timeframes associated with each source were not compiled, however, data collection likely was conducted starting a few years prior to and up until the source publication date. ","completenessDescription":"The following flow data are missing from this dataset: particulate matter emissions (from equipment processing) and stormwater emissions (i.e., only the volume of stormwater is accounted for), In the absence of additional information, it was assumed that mixed CDD is transported 20 km from the point of generation to the mixed CDD MRF.","dataSelectionDescription":"test data selection","reviewDetails":"This dataset has been internally reviewed","dataTreatmentDescription":"A total of 16 respondents to the CDRA (2015) survey provided information on electricity consumption, diesel consumption, land occupation, material throughput, diversion rates, and recovered material composition. These data were used to estimate the inputs/outputs of an average US facility. Each flow was normalized with the facility throughput.\n\nEquipment operation/utilization and materials used in facility construction were estimated for 2 mixed CDD MRFs in southeastern US. Construction materials were estimated by taking onsite dimensional measurement of facility infrastructure. The total amount of each of these materials was then quantified on a mass basis through the use of typical density values for each material type (e.g., concrete, steel). The total tonnage of materials accepted at each of the two facilities was found for years 2013-2015. An average annual tonnage was then calculated using these tonnage amounts. Service lives for the different materials were estimated using values presented in Townsend and Cochran (2010). The total tonnage of each material was then divided by its service life to approximate the quantity of that material necessary each year. These quantities were then divided by the average annual facility throughput to approximate the mass of each construction material needed per mass of throughput.\n\nThe equipment manufacturer-listed horse power ratings of each piece of equipment inventoried at the 2 sites visited by IWCS (2015) were used in conjunction with the US EPA (2014) Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) database to quantify equipment usage according to fuel consumption. The US EPA (2014) MOVES database was also used to estimate equipment utilization, based on the nationwide average total fuel consumption values listed for specific equipment types.\n\nUtilization of electric-powered equipment (e.g., trommels, finger screens), equipment support infrastructure, staircases and platforms, and steel wall partitions was estimated on a mass basis, assuming a 20-year functional/serviceable life. The total mass of each equipment/equipment support infrastructure type inventoried by IWCS (2015) was divided by the average annual throughput reported by the facility from 2013-2015 (i.e., quantities reported to the state\u0027s permitting authority).\n\nLand occupation was estimated by dividing the total site areas reported by all 16 respondents and dividing this value by the total throughput reported by the corresponding throughput, assuming a facility lifespan of 20 years. A 12\u0027 x 56\u0027 standard office trailer was assumed for use for administrative purposes at mixed CDD MRFs.\n\nMixed CDD MRFs commonly use onsite wells as a source of water for wet dust suppression; therefore, water consumption is typically not tracked at these facilities. Total facility water consumption was estimated from three specific uses: water use by misting cannons, water use by the sprinkler system located at the top of the perimeter wall, and water use for paved surface dust control. Manufacturer specifications of misting cannon equipment present at one of the two sites reviewed by IWCS (2015) and operating time period assumptions were used to estimate water consumption for these devices. The number and style of sprinkler heads, sprinkler nozzle specifications, and the same operating time period assumptions were used to estimate sprinkler water consumption. The total area of paved surfaces, and a water application rate and frequency to achieve nearly 70% dust control (with brooming), as described in US EPA (1985), was used to estimate the total amount of water necessary for paved surface dust suppression.\n\nA water balance was conducted assuming that all water consumption for the purposes of dust control is returned to the atmosphere as water vapor, whereas all water resulting from rainfall onto paved surfaces is collected and managed as stormwater. Average nationwide precipitation was estimated from NOAA (2016). The average paved fraction of the total site area was calculated from Google Earth aerial imagery for four CDRA (2015) respondent sites. This fraction was multiplied by the land occupation value and the average nationwide precipitation. Due to an absence of information, specific emissions associated with stormwater discharge to surface water from these facilities are not included in this dataset. Therefore, the surface water emissions flow is only considered partially accounted for in this dataset. \n\nSeveral of the construction/equipment manufacturing material input flows are approximated through the use of surrogates due to flow availability in the existing US LCI database. Steel consumption uses \"steel, billets, at plant\" to approximate the environmental burdens associated with structural steel production. \"Surfaced dried lumber, at planar mill, US SE\" was used to represent all onsite dimensional lumber use (e.g., fence posts and slats, 2\"x4\"s), UV-stabilized high density polyethylene (HDPE) fence privacy screen was approximated through the use of \"Polyethylene, high density, resin, at plant\". Vinyl flooring tiles and vinyl canvas (used as a weather covering for an outdoor work area) were simulated through the use of \"polyvinyl chloride, resin, at plant\" as a proxy. ","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional","modelingConstantsDescription":"A primary assumption of this dataset is that all incoming CDD loads arrive at the MRF as mixed material. In actual practice, some loads already represent individual materials and are a product of specific demolition activities, such as road demolition, land clearing, and roofing projects. These loads may not (and commonly do not) receive the same degree of processing as mixed loads. Because the CDRA (2015)-reported data do not provide details on the fraction of loads arriving in mixed vs material-specific loads, this dataset presents all loads as arriving as mixed CDD.\n\nAnother primary assumption is that the equipment inventory compiled from a detailed inspection of two large-scale mixed CDD MRFs (IWCS 2015) is reflective of a representative inventory of the average nationwide facility.\n\nThis dataset assumes that PM emissions resulting from paved surfaces, processing, and stockpile management are negligible. The extent of wet suppression techniques utilized at the sites inspected by IWCS (2015) suggests a very high degree of dust control. \n\nThe dataset user should note that stormwater is commonly impounded onsite in stormwater retention ponds. The dataset presents a flow to surface water as leaving the system boundary for water balance accounting purposes, since values for pond water loss through groundwater infiltration and evaporation are unknown. Stormwater quality data for mixed CDD MRFs was not found at the time this dataset was developed.","samplingDescription":"Two primary data collection efforts were used in the development of this dataset. The first of these was a 2014 nationwide survey of CDD MRFs as discussed in CDRA (2015). Facilities were asked to provide 2013 information on fuel consumption, electricity consumption, facility land area, and data on  the quality and quantity of the incoming and outgoing CDD streams. This information was used as the basis for the development of the energy demand, land occupation, surface water generation and outgoing material composition presented in the dataset.\nThe other data collection effort included a site visit to two large-scale (i.e., the two largest CDRA (2015) respondent) facilities in southeastern US. The purpose of these visits was to estimate the quantity of materials utilized in facility construction and equipment manufacturing. Extensive measurements were taken of facility buildings, equipment and infrastructure and individual material were quantified by mass.","restrictionsDescription":"CC0 1.0 Universal\r\nAlthough the information in this document has been funded by the U.S. EPA, it does not necessarily reflect the views of the Agency and no official endorsement should be inferred. \r\n","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2016-01-01-05:00","validUntil":"2016-12-31-05:00","intendedApplication":"This process may be used in any LCA, noting the limitations of the dataset.\n\n","projectDescription":"This dataset was prepared by Innovative Waste Consulting Services, LLC under subcontract to the CSC Government Solutions, LLC for the US EPA, Office of Research and Development, Cincinnati, OH under prime contract number EP-C-15-012.","geographyDescription":"Equipment inventory information and water consumption data was developed from a detailed inspection of 2 large-scale mixed CDD MRFS in the southeastern US.
